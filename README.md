## What is SCSS and why use it? 

It is a way to right styles with more enchanced syntax. it is a preprocessor that will compile the syntatic sugar down to regular CSS when the code is compiled at runtime. SCSS, which stands for Sassy CSS, is similar to regular CSS in that it uses curly braces and semicolons. Any valid CSS is valid SCSS, but SCSS also allows for nested selectors and the deployment of mixins and global variables. 

The use of nesting in particular provides for much more organize and concise code, which cuts down on having to hunt for the right css selector or having to worry about whether changing the attributes of that selector will change a style somewhere else in your program. 

## How does this project use the Mobile Mixin?
